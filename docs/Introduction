In this project the main goal is to determine the performance characteristics of underlying hardware components. 
Understanding about the performance of the basic operations, which would be valuable in identifying performance bottlenecks. 
The project discusses set of metrics which can be used to evaluate the performance of certain features of an Operating System.
 
Language used for calculating the metrics is “C” with the compiler  NUMBER and Python.

The first phase of the project (machine description, CPU, Scheduling, and OS Services) was completed in an estimated time of 
8 hours per head totalling to 24 hours. We estimate that the remaining project would take 32 hours more per head.
